          “The doors to the world of the wild Self are few but precious. If you have a deep scar, that is a door, if you have an old, old story, that is a door. If you love the sky and the water so much you almost cannot bear it, that is a door. If you yearn for a deeper life, a full life, a sane life, that is a door.”

And, sadder still, there always is a chorus of willing intellectuals to say calming words about benign or altruistic empires, as if one shouldn’t trust the evidence of one’s eyes watching the destruction and the misery and death brought by the latest mission civilisatrice.”

        <p className="mb-4" text-lg>
            I love reading literature and poems from my homeland Kashmir. 
            They often draw from metaphors of nature and theme spirituality, 
            patriotism, love of the land, and solidarity. Below I share some.
