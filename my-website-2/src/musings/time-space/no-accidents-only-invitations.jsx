      <br />
      <br />
      It began with the softest sounds <br />
      the crack of a teacup against the desk, <br />
      a dark flood of tea bleeding across scattered papers <br />
      For a long moment, I just watched it spread, as if <br />
      something inside me had <br />
      finally leaked out into the world where I could see it. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I could have dismissed it: an accident, nothing more <br />
      I had lifted the cup too quickly, not paid attention <br />
      Simple cause, simple effect <br />
      That is the story we are taught to tell ourselves.
      <br />
      <br />
      But part of me <br />
      a quieter part, the part that watches without speaking <br />
      knew otherwise <br />
      Something was answering me.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the weeks before, my heart had trembled with doubt, <br/>
      grief, and unfinished prayers <br />
      The kind of unease you can almost ignore during the day, but <br />
      which sits heavy in the chest when the lights go out <br />
      I hadn't confessed it to anyone <br />
      I hadn't even confessed it fully to myself <br />
      Yet somehow, the world had heard.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was only much later, in the slow untangling of <br />
      reflection, that I would remember <br />
      Imam Al-Ghazali's words: <br />
      Nothing moves by its own power. Every moment is a fresh creation <br />
      Causality is an illusion laid gently across reality to comfort the limited mind.
      <br />
      <br />
      God creates each event separately, distinctly, by His will alone <br />
      And what appears as causality <br />
      the endless weaving of action and reaction <br />
      is only the rhythm He allows us to recognize, <br />
      a mercy to the easily bewildered human intellect. 
      <br />
      <br />
      The human heart, that restless compass within the chest, is stitched <br />
      into this ever renewing world. <br />
      It speaks, and the world listens <br />
      not by magic, nor by manifestation, nor by the arrogant illusion that <br />
      thought commands matter. <br />
      But because the Creator is merciful enough to answer the heart's hidden <br />
      languages, even when the tongue stays silent. 
      <br />
      <br />
      A restless heart may find itself mirrored in restless events: <br />
      spilled tea, shattered glass, <br />
      sharp words that draw blood more easily than they should. 
      <br />
      <br />
      A peaceful heart may find the world softened before it: <br />
      small gifts rising like foam on the tide. <br />
      <br />
      Not because the heart controls reality, but because the heart meets it <br />
      and God, in His infinite tenderness, lets the world become a mirror. 
      <br />
      <br />
      The heart that recognizes this mirroring learns to turn, to seek <br />
      alignment with the Divine will. <br />
      This is why repentance is not just moral correction; it is metaphysical renewal. <br />
      It is the turning of the heart <br />
      and by turning, the quiet redirection of the whole world. 
      <br />
      <br />
      When the heart shifts, the world can shift. 
      <br />
      <br />
      This is the secret the spilled tea was trying to tell me: <br />
      that every disruption is also an opening, every small break a chance to begin again. <br />
      And if this is true, if one cracked teacup can carry such weight, <br />
      then what of all the other moments we dismiss as mere accidents? 
      <br />
      <br />
      Reality changes with this recognition: <br />
        There are no small moments. No accidents, only invitations, folded invisibly into the hours, <br />
      "Return to Me." 
      <br />
      <br />  
      And when the heart does return <br />
      softly, like coming home after long wandering, we see <br />
      what was always there: <br />
      the universe, fragile <br />
      not because it is weak, but because it is alive <br />
      endlessly reborn, endlessly willing to speak. 
      <br />
      <br />
      And powerful, because: <br />
      every breath is an unwritten page upon which repentance, <br />
      remembrance, and longing can ink new possibilities. 
      <br />
      <br />
      To walk through life with this awareness is <br />
      to live as if every second carries a secret, <br />
      a secret that draws you closer <br />
      to the One who holds all moments in His hand.
