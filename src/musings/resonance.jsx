            &quot;We allow ourselves to be blown by the winds because we do know what we want: our hearts know it, even if our thoughts are sometimes slow to follow- but in the end, they do catch up with our hearts and then we think we have made a decision.&quot;

          &quot;The doors to the world of the wild Self are few but precious. If you have a deep scar, that is a door, if you have an old, old story, that is a door. If you love the sky and the water so much you almost cannot bear it, that is a door. If you yearn for a deeper life, a full life, a sane life, that is a door.&quot;

          &quot;We all begin the process before we are ready, before we are strong enough, before we know enough; we begin a dialogue with thoughts and feelings that both tickle and thunder within us. We respond before we know how to speak the language, before we know all the answers, and before we know exactly to whom we are speaking.&quot;

          &quot;Every single empire in its official discourse has said that it is not like all the others, that its circumstances are special, that it has a mission to enlighten, civilize, bring order and democracy, and that it uses force only as a last resort. And, sadder still, there always is a chorus of willing intellectuals to say calming words about benign or altruistic empires, as if one shouldn&apos;t trust the evidence of one&apos;s eyes watching the destruction and the misery and death brought by the latest mission civilisatrice.&quot;

            I love reading literature and poems from my homeland Kashmir. 
            They often draw from metaphors of nature and theme spirituality, 
            patriotism, love of the land, and solidarity. Below I share some.
